# UCF Composition 2 Pure Data resources

I will upload start/finish files as they are relevant to class activities. You can download the files by clicking "Clone or download" > "Download ZIP".  

## Resources

- [puredata.info](http://puredata.info) - This is about as close to an official website as there is for Pd. (The real [official site](http://msp.ucsd.edu/) is not very useful for much beyond downloading the tool.)
- [Pd forums](https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/) - There are nice people here. Be nice and ask specific questions if you are looking for help. Or, you can just search their very useful archives. 
- [Pure Data Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL12DC9A161D8DC5DC) by Rafael Hernandez - Hernandez offers some succinct introductory videos that are a good place to start. When he refers to "Pure Data extended", note that it no longer is supported. The modern equivalent is Pd-l2Ork, or [Purr Data](https://github.com/jonwwilkes/purr-data/releases). If you're using Pd on the iMacs in the lab, they're running "vanilla" Pd. Everything he demonstrates here will work fine in both places. Also, you don't necessarily need to watch them in sequence. Once you get through the basics, feel free to jump around if you see a topic that interests you.
